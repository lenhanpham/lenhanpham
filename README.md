# Hi

I'm a theoretical, computational, and physical chemist with a strong background in data analysis, machine learning models, and data science. My work focuses on developing computational tools and methods for quantum chemistry, molecular simulations, and materials science. I enjoy bridging chemistry with programming to solve complex problems in chemistry, materials (2D, nano crystals, bio, polymers, surface), and biotechnology. Currently, I am working on and interested in intelligent platforms for computational chemistry and materials research discovery. 

## Research Highlights

Here are some of my notable publications:

- **Predicting Biomolecule Adsorption on MoSâ‚‚ Nanosheets with High Structural Fidelity**(Chemical Science, 2022)
- **Investigating Competing Inner- and Outer-Sphere Electron-Transfer Pathways in Copper Photoredox-Catalyzed Atom-Transfer Radical Additions: Closing the Cycle** (Angewandte Chemie International Edition, 2024)
- **Photocatalytic Generation of Alkyl Carbanions from Aryl Alkenes** (Nature Catalysis, 2024)
- **Sustainable Gold Extraction from Ore and Electronic Waste** (Nature Sustainability, 2025)
